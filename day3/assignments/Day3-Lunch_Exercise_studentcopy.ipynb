    "## Example data from the wild!! \n",
    "Brauer 2008 used microarrays to test the effect of starvation and growth rate on baker’s yeast (S. cerevisiae, a popular model organism for studying molecular genomics because of its simplicity). Basically, if you give yeast plenty of nutrients (a rich media), except that you sharply restrict its supply of one nutrient, you can control the growth rate to whatever level you desire (we do this with a tool called a chemostat). For example, you could limit the yeast’s supply of glucose (sugar, which the cell metabolizes to get energy and carbon), of leucine (an essential amino acid), or of ammonium (a source of nitrogen).\n",
    "\n",
    "“Starving” the yeast of these nutrients lets us find genes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise or lower their activity in response to growth rate. Growth-rate dependent expression patterns can tell us a lot about cell cycle control, and how the cell responds to stress.\n",
    "Respond differently when different nutrients are being limited. These genes may be involved in the transport or metabolism of those nutrients.\n",
    "Sounds pretty cool, right? So let’s get started!\n",

A higher value means the gene was more expressed in that sample, lower means the gene was less expressed.
