Functions allow you to create reuseable pieces of your programs so you can run a block of specificed code anywhere in your program, as many times as you need, with any modifications or variables that you might need. As an example, lets start by figuring out what the GC% is for a given nucleic acid string.  To do this, we will need to learn the length of the oligonucleotide sequence, as well as the number of 'G' and 'C' bases.  Lets start by figuring out a way to do this for one DNA sequence."
