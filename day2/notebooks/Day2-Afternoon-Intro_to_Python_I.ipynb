    "There are numerous programming languages from which to choose.  Many of them specialized for specific types of tasks. Python, like others, is a general purpose and high-level programming language and can be used for a variety of applications. There are a few reasons however why you might choose to work in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code readability and maintenance\n",
    "Python syntax and formatting emphasizes code readability. In many cases, python code often reads close to english sentences instead of quirky syntax. This makes it a useful language to learn as a first language, but also helps others quickly interpret what is actually happening in your code. This helps with mainintaining old code as well and makes updating and sharing materials easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compatibility\n",
    "Python supports many operating systems natively.  Meaning your python code can be readily ported across systems with little to no effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Robust built-in libraries\n",
    "Python has a HUGE developer community supporting it.  This means that many functions, methods, and utilities ALREADY exist and you can stand on the shoulders of those who have already spent a decent amount of time figuring out how to do something in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large number of statistics and bioinformatics modules\n",
    "Aside from the built-in modules, there is also a large community of bioinformatics, general biology, and statistics developers who have contributed packages for python. This includes a number of large frameworks including BioPython that help ease entry and streamline more complex workflows."
